*First off, a brief presentation.*

*My full name is Leon Collazo Arechaga, you can call me Leon, or Leo.*

*I was born in the 12th of May, 1999. In short 12/05/1999, or 05/12/1999 for some... Or even 1999/05/12*

*Aside from the currently lacking amount of certificates (for my taste), I'll tell you a bit about myself; Linux, Windows Powershell, 
and butchering computers taught me a lot from a young age, it always intrigued me the inner workings of things, whether they worked or not.
I am by no means a scholar, just a guy who had a lot of free time when younger and spent it on my hobby. I'm almost self-taught. I did some courses here and there, but
I've mostly spent my time playing around with Bash, Powershell, Python, and dipped my toes into some web design projects. My strong suite is IT. SysAdmin has been my
go-to work for some time.*

*Now we get to leave the personal stuff behind us and dive into some certificates I currently have and (hopefully) the ones I'll adquire over time, enjoy?*

**This simple description serves the purpose of going into more detail about the certificates I put here, with the intent of providing more context onto how I further developed on some of the fields I studied.**

**B2 certificate:**

*This certificate is pretty old and I've gotten a lot better in english since then. My grammar is still a weak spot sometimes, but I manage that pretty well over-all nowadays, I've had a lot of practice talking while visiting
other countries, and also talking to people who speak English.*

**Argentina Programa Parte 1. #SeProgramar**

*This certificate isn't something huge, but it is something. It's from an entry-level course of fullstack development*
*. It's worth mentioning that this course was a part of a two-part course, where the other part went full into detail of how to work with Angular, Typescript, Bootspring and other web dev tools, and*
*while I didn't do the final project fully, due to a lack of time, I did learn quite a few things that have helped me a lot in the understanding of backend and networking, and it also allows me to*
*Sometimes play around with web-design if the need ever arises*
